Steps to build junit:

- Must be manual
  - Write release notes
  - Update SNAPSHOT version in pom.xml
- Not too tedious:
  - Push to github (dsaff _and_ KentBeck)
  - Run the mvn clean install
  - Upload stuff to github (including tag)
  - If not done, update src/main/config/settings.xml in /private/.../settings.xml on CloudBees' webdav share.
  - If not done, copy GnuPG keys in to ${gpg.homedir}. See settings.xml.
  - Perform Maven Release in Jenkins
    - (to deploy snapshot version) mvn clean deploy
    - (to deploy specified release version) mvn clean release:prepare release:perform
  - Promote the maven artifacts and close staging repository if release successfully
- Tedious:
  - Update SourceForge if major release
  - Update javadocs on github site (and "latest" link)
  - Update javadocs on junit.org
  - Put release notes on github.
  - Announce on blog, user list, dev list, announce list, junit.org, twitter 
- Profit!
